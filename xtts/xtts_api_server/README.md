# Patcher for xtts to support interruptions (stop on user speech)

Tested with latest xtts_api_server 0.8.6 (released Jan 2 2024), if you have older version - it may not work.

## Patch
- Stop xtts_api_server if running.
- Copy 2 files (patch_xtts_api_server.py, restore_xtts_api_server.py) to /xtts_api_server directory. Usually it is somewhere here:
`c:\Users\[USER]\miniconda3\Lib\site-packages\xtts_api_server`
- Double click `patch_xtts_api_server.py` to patch files (or run in cmd: `python patch_xtts_api_server.py`). Check that there are no errors. It will create .bkp files, then will patch original .py files.

## Restore
If you need to restore original files run:
`restore_xtts_api_server.py`

If you need to update xtts_api_server or need to re-patch it (patcher won't patch already patched files):
- run `restore_xtts_api_server.py`
- update xtts_api_server using pip or git
- run `patch_xtts_api_server.py`


## Modified files:
- server.py
- \RealtimeTTS\text_to_stream.py

Full list of modificitaions can be seen in patch_xtts_api_server, it has simple needle->replacement method.
